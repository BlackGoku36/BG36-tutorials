# Introduction

[Kha](http://kha.tech/) is ultra-portable, high performance, open-source multimedia framework. It is low level SDK for building cross-platform games and media applications. With the help of Haxe Programming language and the [Krafix shader-compiler](https://github.com/Kode/krafix) it can cross-compile your code and optimize your assets. Kha gives you a common API to graphics, audio, input, and networking, for platforms such as Web, Mobile, Desktop, Consoles. And Graphics APIs such as Metal, Vulkan, DirectX, WebGL and OpenGL. So it is basically it is [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) but stronger.

### Language
It is written in Haxe, a strictly-typed high-level open-source programming language with cross-compiler. It is possible to use C/C++ with Kinc, which is like kha but for C/C++ (Kha uses Kinc for C/C++ targets).

### Targets

It support many different platforms with different graphics api:
* macOS (Metal or Open-GL).
* iOS (Metal or Open-GL).
* windows (D3D9/11/12, Vulkan or Open-GL).
* linux (Vulkan or Open-GL).
* HTML5 (WebGL1/2 and canvas).
* [etc](https://github.com/Kode/Kha/wiki/Features).

Complete structure of Kha look something like this:
